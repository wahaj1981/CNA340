# Last Assignment for CNE330 

This Python function captures that algorithm. Try running this program several times supplying different values for n.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running your first Python script on your local machine, which you will use to experiment as part of your CNE330 class.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.13 to run, along with the following packages or libraries:
NumPy: for numerical operations.
Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
TensorFlow: for machine learning.
Additionally, it is recommended to use PyCharm https://pycharm-community-edition.en.softonic.com/ as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python development.

Follow these steps to download and install Python 3.13, PyCharm, and then install the required packages:

Download Python 3.13 Installer:
Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/.
Download the Python 3.13 installer for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Run the Python 3.13 Installer:

For Windows: Run the .exe file and ensure you check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
For macOS/Linux: Follow the instructions on the website to install Python 3.13 for your platform.
Download and Install PyCharm:

Go to the official JetBrains website: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.
Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Community Edition is free).
Install required packages: After Python 3.13 is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests flask beautifulsoup4 sqlalchemy tensorflow jupyter

```

## Running
Once you have installed the required dependencies and set up your environment, you can run the program with the following commands on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
1.	Basic Run (Windows/macOS/Linux): To run the script interactively:
```
python Assignment1.py
```
This will prompt you to enter a value for n during runtime, and the program will be executed based on your input.
2.	Running with a File Input (Windows/macOS/Linux): To run the script with a file as an argument (e.g., test.txt), use the following command:
```
python Assignment1.py test.txt
```
The file should contain the input values needed by the program, and the script will read and process the data from the file.
________________________________________
Running on Linux
For Linux users, ensure that the script has executable permissions. You can make the script executable and run it directly without using python as follows:
1.	Make the Script Executable:
Run this command to make the Python file executable:
```
chmod +x Assignment1.py
```
2.	Run the Script Directly:
After making the script executable, you can run it directly by typing:
```
./Assignment1.py
```
This will execute the script just like the other methods, allowing for interactive input, file input, or command-line arguments.


## Thanks
I want to thank the following:
I used my instructor's demo video to guide me through the assignment. 
I also used some YouTube videos, such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0GjKG4gRmY
I used ChatGPT to understand how to write the running part.
